This repository contains all of the relevant codes in order to perform the machine learning analysis for the onset of common SAE groups. The codes provide the following information: splitting the data into training and testing, KNN imputation, normalisation of data, hyper-parameter tuning, cross-validation, XGBOOST implementation, applying the model to the testing data and generation of SHAP values.

The scripts can be repeated in order to generate 100 runs for each of the different “vs” group.

Requests for the model data for each group can be made to the author upon successful approval from Project Data Sphere to access the data from the following clinical trials: NCT02499770, NCT00143455, NCT01439568, NCT00119613 and NCT00363415.
